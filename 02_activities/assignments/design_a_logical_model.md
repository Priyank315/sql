# Assignment 1: Design a Logical Model

## Question 1
Create a logical model for a small bookstore. ðŸ“š

At the minimum it should have employee, order, sales, customer, and book entities (tables). Determine sensible column and table design based on what you know about these concepts. Keep it simple, but work out sensible relationships to keep tables reasonably sized. Include a date table. There are several tools online you can use, I'd recommend [_Draw.io_](https://www.drawio.com/) or [_LucidChart_](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/).

## Question 2
We want to create employee shifts, splitting up the day into morning and evening. Add this to the ERD.
Answer: Done Added

## Question 3
The store wants to keep customer addresses. Propose two architectures for the CUSTOMER_ADDRESS table, one that will retain changes, and another that will overwrite. Which is type 1, which is type 2?

_Hint, search type 1 vs type 2 slowly changing dimensions._

Bonus: Are there privacy implications to this, why or why not?
```
Your answer: Storing customer addresses has privacy implications, particularly with Type 2. Retaining a history of addresses could violate privacy regulations if not handled properly, especially if customers request data deletion or if a breach occurs. This makes Type 1 a simpler, less risky approach, though Type 2 offers valuable historical data.
```

## Question 4
Review the AdventureWorks Schema [here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/LMu4W.gif)

Highlight at least two differences between it and your ERD. Would you change anything in yours?
```
Your answer --> Product Catalog: AdventureWorks has a detailed product catalog that includes multiple categories and subcategories, which a simple bookstore schema might not need. In contrast, our ERD only tracks basic book information.

Complexity in Address Handling: AdventureWorks has a complex address handling system with multiple address types (billing, shipping). We have proposed a simpler Customer_Address table with Type 1 and Type 2 options.

More detailed Customer_address and Product_catalog will help when business will grow larger. I'll add that more or change it in my DB.
