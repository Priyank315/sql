**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

In order for me to adjust on my previous work based on the ethics, I believe by learning the code more and making sure we perform the actions, keeping in mind the sanctity and the safety of the data, would make it more ethical. In other words, if we try to make the data more secure, keeping in mind that they are not calculated based on the human race, but purely on the practical data, [for example, hiding personal details of the person, not making a mandate of last name or first name for my queries, but more on the user ID].

Once I read the story on Pakistani computerized Nation ID card, it really got me thinking how should we analyze such any important information more efficiently and what should we do in order to make the work, more robust, smooth and efficient in order to not make the computation complex and rather, making it free from any abstract or non-important value in order to make sure that the reason why we create the the database is being used seamlessly and effortlessly without any breakages.

Ofcourse, inequity is a major part which was covered by the data shared b Boykis V., in regards to the way the data was collected. It possibly was a smart way, but unethical, making an inequity on a major basis. We already know that AI driven or establishment organization has been using the data or submitting requests/jobs in places, cities or countries that are underpriviledged, just to exploit them in a lawful manner, and hence booking more profits with least investment. However, the database created was in an unethical way, which needs to be stopped or controlled by a central governing body, created together by bringing the countries under one roof and assuring that all the inputs given here to make the database for AI or for any organization should be given equality with equal profits, by all means.
